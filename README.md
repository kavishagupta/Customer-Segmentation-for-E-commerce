# Customer-Segmentation-for-E-commerce


## Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation for e-commerce businesses using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal is to divide the customer base into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior and other features, allowing for targeted marketing strategies and improved customer experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and documentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from [insert source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, etc.]. The dataset contains information about customer transactions, including:

- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Purchase Amount**: Total amount spent by the customer.
- **Frequency**: Number of purchases made by the customer.
- **Recency**: Days since the last purchase.
- **Demographic Information**: Such as age, gender, location (if available).

[Optional: Link to the dataset if publicly available]

## Features

The project implements the following features:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns
- Application of clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) for segmentation
- Visualization of customer segments
- Recommendations for targeted marketing strategies based on segments

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ks7210/customer-segmentation-ecommerce.git
   cd customer-segmentation-ecommerce


2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the analysis, open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Then, navigate to `Customer_Segmentation_Analysis.ipynb` and follow the instructions within the notebook.

## Methods

This project utilizes the following methods for customer segmentation:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand customer behavior and features.
- **Clustering Algorithms**:
  - **K-Means Clustering**: Used to group customers into K segments based on purchasing behavior.
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Alternative method for segmenting customers into a tree-like structure.
- **Validation**: Evaluating the effectiveness of clustering through metrics like Silhouette Score.

## Results

The project results include:

- Visualizations of customer segments in 2D space.
- A summary of the characteristics of each segment.
- Recommendations for marketing strategies tailored to each customer segment.
